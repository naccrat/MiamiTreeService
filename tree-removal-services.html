          <p>One of the most common reasons is safety for yourself and your property. Trees can be dangerous when damaged or diseased. They can become dangerous when they grow too close to power lines or other structures. If a tree falls it can cause damage or injury. It's important to have the tree removed as soon as possible.</p>

          <h2 class="py-3">Dead or dying tress</h2>
          <p>Tree removal is important for dead or dying trees because they can become a safety hazard. When trees are unhealthy or dead, they can fall over unexpectedly, which can cause damage to property or even hurt people. Removing dead or dying trees helps to prevent these accidents from happening. Diseased trees can spread their illness to other nearby trees, causing an entire area of trees to become sick or die. Removing a dead or dying tree is important for safety and keeping other trees healthy.</p>
